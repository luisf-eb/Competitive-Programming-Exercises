# Competitive Programming Exercises

## About

This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems that I'm practicing. My goal is to improve my skills in C++ and prepare for high-level contests. I'm using the book "Competitive Programming 4" by Steven Halim as my primary resource for these exercises and some contests (from Online Judges like [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/), [Virtual Judges](https://vjudge.net/) etc.).
